# Unravelinator

Behold, the unravel-inator!

I'm currently porting this to OpenUSD from a Maya script I had written a while ago. Right now it unravels a torus with a hard-coded traversal order. But with some extra work it should be able to support any mesh you throw at it.

To generate `out.usda` with SkelRoot:

```
python3 torus_unravel.py
```
